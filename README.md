## Ch 1 
* __computer program__ (software) - a structured combination of data and instructions used to operate a computer to produce a spcific result.
* __Programming__ - the process of writing a computer program in a language the computer can respond to and other programmers can understand.
* __programming language__ - The set of instructions, data, and rules used to construct a program.
	* __high-level language__ - Languages using instructions resembling written languages, such as English e.g. (Visual Basic, C, C++, and Java).
		* The final program can written in these languages can be run on a variety of computer types (IBM, Apple, Hewlett-Packard)
	* __low-level languages__ - tied to one type of computer processor/architecture. Can be faster than higher level languages.

	* __procedural language__ - Instructions are used to create self-contained units, referred to as procedures. These procedures work by:
		1. accept data as input.
		2. transform the data.
		3. output data for next procedure to use.
	* __object-oriented language__ - programs exist as object which contain attributes and methods to act on.

* __Algorithm__ - step-by-step sequence of instructions that describe how to perform a computation.
* __Pseudocode__ - using english words to describe the steps in an algorithm
* __formula__ - using mathematical equations to describe an algorithm
* __flowchart__ - using a diagram with symbols to describe an algorithm
